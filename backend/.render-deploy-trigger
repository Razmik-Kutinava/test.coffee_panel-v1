Deploy ID: fix-image-upload-render-env
Purpose: Add SUPABASE environment variables to Render deployment

## Changes:
- Added SUPABASE_URL to render.yaml
- Added SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY to render.yaml
- This will enable image upload functionality on Render

## Required Environment Variables on Render Dashboard:
After this deployment, make sure to add these env vars in Render Dashboard:

1. SUPABASE_URL = https://wntvxdgxzenehfzvorae.supabase.co
2. SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = [your service role key from .env]

## Test after deployment:
curl -X POST https://test-coffee-panel-v1.onrender.com/products/upload-image -F "image=@test.jpg"

Should return 200 OK with imageUrl in response.
